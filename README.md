# Advent of Code Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges, written in Go. The Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and challenge types.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual December event where programmers of all skill levels are invited to solve small coding puzzles every day until Christmas. Each puzzle grants "stars", and the goal is to collect as many stars as possible.

## Objectives

- Improve my proficiency in Go.
- Explore different problem-solving techniques and algorithms.
- Participate in a fun and engaging coding challenge.

## Structure of the Repository

Each day's challenge is in its own directory, named in the format `dayXX` where `XX` is the day number. For example, the solution for Day 1 is in the `day1` directory.


## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the day's directory:

cd dayXX

2. Run the Go File

go run dayXX.go
